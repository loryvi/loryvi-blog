# Introduction

Last December 2023, I recently joined a class from Filipino Web Development Peers on Discord hosted by a mentor who is 15 year old but already expert on HTML, CSS, Javascript!

A task was given to us where have to make a component of a Checkout Card Component.
The UI is inspired from Figma Community by Softwareseni and Wirak S. [https://www.figma.com/community/file/1158585574208802327/checkout-page](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1158585574208802327/checkout-page)
