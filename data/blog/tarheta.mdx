Tarheta is a powerful web application designed for both students and teachers to make learning more engaging and efficient.
With Tarheta, users can create flashcards for quizzes, exams, and reviewers, allowing them to review and reinforce key concepts in an interactive and enjoyable way.
For teachers, Tarheta also provides the option to create classes, enabling them to organize simultaneous tests and quiz-taking for their students.
Additionally, the application offers several flashcard organization features and a real-time notification system, ensuring that users never miss an important update or deadline.
Built using the CodeIgniter 3 framework and MySQL for the database,
Tarheta is a robust and reliable tool for enhancing learning outcomes.

## I collaborated with 7 developers to create the whole project. I and other 2 developers was responsible for creating the UI using html and bootstrap, ensuring that the UI/UX is followed.

## This was a final project for our college coursework CS351L-M / CS352-M.
